Here is a list of tools and projects that I have worked on or are still currently working on.

* [text2num](http://www.quangn.com/text2num/): Convert textual numbers to their numeric representations.
* [Skytrax Dataset](https://github.com/quankiquanki/skytrax-reviews-dataset): An air travel dataset consisting of user reviews from the [Skytrax website](http://www.airlinequality.com/). The dataset categorises the reviews into Airline, Airport, Seat and Lounge reviews.
* [wxPython-OpenCV](https://github.com/quankiquanki/wxPython-OpenCV) (work-in-progress): A template / boilerplate application that combines wxPython with OpenCV. It serves as a base to deploy and distribute your OpenCV code as a Desktop Application.
